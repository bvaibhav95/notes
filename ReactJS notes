>>>Most browsers don't support ES6 imports hence we need to bundle our all js code into one single js file and then render into HTML...hence webpack(bundles all assets into single file and then uses into HTML)

>>>ES6 ---(Babel)---> ES5

>>>Virtual DOM(react's DOM in js format viz is really fast) representation of actual DOM(very slow), while re-rendering it will compare the old virtual DOM and new virtual DOM...and then only re-render the changes. 

npx vs npm 
npx - npm package runner - doesn't download the package
npm - downloads package and then we use it 

Types of components
1. Stateless/Functional/Dumb/Presentation comp
>this is not available
>return only html i.e. jsx
>we might wonder that when we import React in function comps, React isn't actually gets used...no...
Ex. return (<h1>Hello world</h1>) ---> return (React.createComponent(h1, null, 'Hello world'))
2. StateFul/Class/Smart/Container comp


props vs state
1.props - passed from outside the comp
props are immutable i.e inside comp we cannot do props.name = 'abc'
2.state - managed by comp and private to the comp
