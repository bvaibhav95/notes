=================JSP & Servlets notes============

1.Servlets don't have "main" method...rather it has some othe methods for the execution.

2.Why JSP if servlets can do the things...coz printing all the stuffs which we see on the HTML page...we can't do that using servlet...printing every line

3.Every JSP is converted into java class by server...ex.
<%...%> --> the code inside this goes into thr doGet() method...hence we can't put method inside <%...%> this

4.JSTL --> java code represented in the xml format

5.Servlet is a small java program that will run on the web server(Tomcat) or app server (JBoss)...servlets receive and respond to req from web clients,usually across HTTP

6.using servlets we can collect inputs from the users thru the web pages forms and save it to DB...get the records from a DB and present to the user...can also create pages dynamically

7.Servlet Life cycle:
1.load servlet class
2.create servlet instance
3.call init();
4.call service();
5.call destroy(); --> called once 

8.Server is basically a computer program that provides the services to the other computer program...

9.App server vs Web server
app server contains the web server + EJB container (can be used for servlet,jsp,struts,jsf.ejb,etc)

App server basically provides the app level services like connection poolong, msg service, transaction support,etc

while web server supports only HTTP content

App servers --> JBoss, GlassFish(sun microsystems), Weblogic(oracle), WebSphere(IBM),etc

10.Web server can support jsp and dynamic web pages...web server contains web/servlet container...can be used for servlet,jsp,jsf,struts...BUT NOT FOR EJBs

11.Web server --> tomcat,jetty,resin,lighttpd,etc

12.jar cf xyz.war * --> will create the WAR file
