2.Migrate 
3.Security & identity, Complaince
4.Storage
5.Networking and content delivery
6.Messaging
7.Database
8.Management tools

Storage vs Database - We can't store image in a database , so we store image path in the databse and keep file in storage

=====AWS compute services=====

EC2 - simple a rock server

Lambda - not for hosting web application, but used for background tasks
Ex. When we upload image, image compression will be done by Lambda (it works by event trigger mechanism)...which is like background task and then compressed image will be stored in the file systems like S3

Elastic beanstalk - you can host application. It's advanced EC2, you don't have to configure the environment i.e. just choose if it's PHP, JAVA or Python unlike you manually create environment in EC2
Difference between EC2 and beanstalk is beanstalk has limited number of environments
Firewalls will be managed by beanstalk...much more automated things

Elastic load balancer - it will distribute the load among instances via elastic load balancer protocol

AutoScaling - ex. if combined CPU usage goes below/above some level...it will launch new instance or remove instance i.e autoscaling and elastic load balancer goes hand in hand

=====AWS storage services=====

S3 - simple storage service - object oriented file system

CloudFront - CDN

EBS - Elastic block storage - acts like hard drive to EC2...1 EC2 can be connected to many EBS volumes, but vice versa not true

Glacier - data backup...cheap data storage...retriving time would be more

Snowball - physical data transfer to AWS from private datacenter...when u have huge amount (petabytes) of data. no point in  uplading it. Just give it to AWS via physical drive and they will upload

Storage gateway - Provide seamless integration between your on premise(private datacenter) servers and the AWS infrastruture
